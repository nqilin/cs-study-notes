# CS-Study-Notes
A systematic collection of computer science study notes for freshman, focusing on Python/C++ programming and basic CS knowledge. All notes are supplemented with **mind maps designed by PS/AI** for intuitive understanding.
> Suitable for basic knowledge consolidation, interview preparation and daily learning review.

## 📚 Repository Structure
The notes are classified by subject, with detailed subdirectories and code examples for each module.
- Python/
    Basic Syntax.md
    Data Types & Operators.md
    Control Flow.md
    Functions & Classes.md
    File Processing.md
    Web Crawler.md
- C++/
    Basic Syntax.md
    Variables & Pointers.md
    Classes & Inheritance.md
    STL Basic.md
    File I/O.md
- Computer Basics/
    Data Structures.md
    Algorithm Fundamentals.md
    Computer Network.md
    Operating System.md
- Practice/
    Class Exercise Code.md
    Knowledge Summary.md

## 🎯 Learning Objective
- Master the core syntax and practical skills of Python (proficient) and C++ (basic);
- Solidify the foundation of computer science (data structures, algorithms, etc.);
- Form a systematic knowledge system and improve the ability of knowledge combing;
- Provide clear and reusable study materials for future internship and job hunting.

## 📐 Design Integration
Combine PS/AI design skills with technical learning to optimize the presentation of notes:
- Design **mind maps** for key knowledge points (e.g. Python OOP, C++ inheritance) and store them in the corresponding directory;
- Optimize the typesetting of notes with Markdown and design simple visual elements for key content;
- Export high-definition design files (PNG/PDF) and associate them with the corresponding note files for easy viewing.

## 🔧 Technical Stack for Notes
- Markdown: Note writing and typesetting
- Python/C++: Code examples and practical verification
- Photoshop/Illustrator: Mind map and visual design of key knowledge
- Git/GitHub: Version control and note sharing

## 📈 Update Plan
- Update 1-2 knowledge points every day (focus on classroom learning content);
- Supplement code examples while updating notes to achieve "theory + practice";
- Update the mind map design of key modules in time (1 per week).

## 📌 For Job & Cooperation
These notes reflect my **systematic learning ability and basic computer literacy**, which is the foundation of all development work. I am willing to share open source notes and communicate with developers who have the same learning needs.
