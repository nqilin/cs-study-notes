# CS-Study-Notes
A systematic collection of computer science study notes for freshman, focusing on Python/C++ programming and basic CS knowledge. All notes are supplemented with runnable code examples and detailed explanations.

This repository is regularly updated for systematic learning, and is designed to be clear for self-review, internship preparation and open-source sharing.

## 📚 Repository Structure
### Python
The most complete section so far, covering basic syntax for programming beginners.

#### Finished Notes
- [Print & Basic Data Types](Python/Print%20&%20Basic%20Data%20Types.md)
  - print() function, basic data types (int, float, str, bool, None), type checking
- [Variables & Operators](Python/Variables%20&%20Operators.md)
  - Variable naming rules, assignment methods, arithmetic/comparison/logical/assignment operators
- [Control Flow - Conditional Statements](Python/Control%20Flow%20-%20Conditional%20Statements.md)
  - if, else, elif, nested conditions, coding standards for logical branches
- [Control Flow - Loops (for & while)](Python/Control%20Flow%20-%20Loops%20(for%20&%20while).md)
  - for loop with range(), while loop, break/continue, nested loops
- [Data Structures - List Tuple Dict Set](Python/Data%20Structures%20-%20List%20Tuple%20Dict%20Set.md)
  - Four core built-in data structures, mutability/order/duplication features, common operations and practical scenarios

#### Planned Notes
- Functions & Parameters
- Error & Exception Handling
- File I/O Basics

### C++
Planned modules:
- Basic Syntax & Variables
- Pointers & Memory
- STL Containers
- OOP Basics (Class, Inheritance)

### Computer Basics
- Data Structures (Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue)
- Algorithm Fundamentals
- Computer Network & OS Basic Concepts

## 🎯 Learning Objective
- Master core syntax of Python (proficient) and C++ (basic)
- Build a solid computer science foundation
- Form a systematic knowledge structure
- Provide clean, reusable materials for technical interviews and project development

## 📐 Design Integration (PS/AI)
- Mind maps for key knowledge modules will be designed and attached to corresponding notes
- Visual layout optimization for important knowledge points

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Markdown: Note writing and typesetting
- Python / C++: Code examples and verification
- Git / GitHub: Version control and open-source sharing
- Photoshop / Illustrator: Knowledge mind maps and visual design

## 📈 Update Plan
- Update 1~2 knowledge points per day (based on daily study)
- Review and optimize old notes every 7 days
- Add mind maps and design materials weekly

🔍 Weekly Review
Weekly learning reports are stored in the root directory (e.g. week-1report.md), including:
- Knowledge points mastered this week
- Slow-to-learn content & improvement plans
- Code/notes optimization records

## 📌 For Job & Cooperation
This repo demonstrates my systematic learning ability and basic programming literacy.
I welcome suggestions, discussions and potential cooperation related to CS basics and programming practice.
