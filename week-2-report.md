# Week 2 Learning Report

## ✅ Mastered This Week
- C++ Basic Syntax & Variables (data types, I/O, type conversion)
- C++ Pointers & Memory Management (stack/heap, new/delete, pointer arithmetic)
- Key pointer safety practices (nullptr, avoiding dangling pointers/memory leaks)

## 📌 Improvements Needed
- More practice with pointer arithmetic and array-pointer relationships
- Deepen understanding of memory leaks and debugging techniques
- Hands-on exercise for dynamic array allocation/deallocation

## 📝 Notes Optimization
- Added more safety examples for pointer usage
- Clarified stack vs heap memory differences with practical examples
- Fixed minor typos in C++ basic syntax notes
