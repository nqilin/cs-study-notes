# Computer Network Basics

A computer network is a set of interconnected devices that can exchange data and share resources using communication protocols.

## 1. What is a Computer Network?
A network allows computers to communicate with each other.
Common components:
- Computers (hosts)
- Servers
- Routers / Switches
- Cables / Wi‑Fi
- Protocols

---

## 2. Network Types
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**
  Short range (Bluetooth, USB)
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**
  Home, office, school
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
  City-wide network
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
  Global (Internet)
- **WLAN (Wireless LAN)**
  Wi‑Fi

## 3. OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. **Physical** – Electrical signals, cables, Wi‑Fi
2. **Data Link** – Frames, MAC address, Ethernet
3. **Network** – Packets, IP address, routing
4. **Transport** – Segments, TCP/UDP
5. **Session** – Connection setup, maintain, close
6. **Presentation** – Data format, encryption
7. **Application** – HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP

---

## 4. TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
1. **Network Interface**
2. **Internet**
3. **Transport**
4. **Application**

---

## 5. Network Devices
- **Hub** – Broadcasts to all ports
- **Switch** – Forwards to specific MAC
- **Router** – Connects different networks
- **Modem** – Converts digital ↔ analog
- **Access Point** – Provides Wi‑Fi

---

## 6. IP Address
An identifier for a device on a network.

- **IPv4**: 32‑bit, e.g. `192.168.1.1`
- **IPv6**: 128‑bit, longer, more addresses

**Public IP**: Used on the Internet
**Private IP**: Used inside LAN (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16–31.x.x)

---

## 7. MAC Address
Physical address of a network interface.
- 48‑bit hexadecimal
- Burned into the network card
- Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

---

## 8. TCP vs UDP
### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Connection‑oriented
- Reliable, ordered, error‑checked
- Flow control, congestion control
- Used for: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Connectionless
- Fast, no guarantee
- Used for: video call, game, DNS, live stream

---

## 9. Common Network Protocols
- **HTTP** – Web pages (port 80)
- **HTTPS** – Secure web (port 443)
- **DNS** – Domain → IP
- **FTP** – File transfer
- **SMTP** – Send email
- **POP3 / IMAP** – Receive email
- **DHCP** – Assign IP automatically

---

## 10. Network Topologies
- **Bus**
- **Star** (most common)
- **Ring**
- **Mesh**
- **Hybrid**

---

## 11. Important Terms
- **Bandwidth** – Data transfer speed
- **Latency** – Delay
- **Packet** – Small unit of data
- **Firewall** – Security filter
- **Proxy** – Intermediate server
- **VPN** – Virtual Private Network

## 12. Common Interview Questions
1. Explain OSI model layers
2. TCP vs UDP
3. What is an IP address? IPv4 vs IPv6
4. What is DNS? How does it work?
5. What happens when you type a URL in browser?
6. What is a router? What is a switch?
7. What is HTTP? What is HTTPS?
8. What is VPN?
