# Software Engineering Basics

Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development.
It focuses on building reliable, maintainable, and scalable software in a systematic way.

## 1. What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering is:
- Systematic development
- Using best practices
- Building high-quality software
- Working in teams
- Maintaining long-term projects

---

## 2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The process of building software.

### 1. Requirement Analysis
- Understand user needs
- Collect functional & non-functional requirements

### 2. Planning
- Estimate time & cost
- Plan resources
- Risk analysis

### 3. Design
- System architecture
- Database design
- UI/UX design
- Module design

### 4. Implementation (Coding)
- Write actual code
- Follow coding standards
- Unit testing

### 5. Testing
- Find bugs & issues
- Types: unit, integration, system, UAT

### 6. Deployment
- Release to production
- Hosting & setup

### 7. Maintenance
- Fix bugs
- Update features
- Improve performance

---

## 3. Software Development Models

### Waterfall Model
- Linear sequential
- One phase after another
- No going back

### Agile Model
- Iterative & incremental
- Flexible to changes
- Short cycles (sprints)

### Scrum
- Most popular Agile framework
- Sprints: 1–4 weeks
- Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team

### DevOps
- Combines Development + Operations
- Automation, CI/CD
- Faster deployment

---

## 4. Agile Principles
- Individuals & interactions over processes & tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

---

## 5. Version Control
Tracks changes in code.

### Git
- Most popular VCS
- Branch, merge, commit, pull, push

### GitHub / GitLab
- Online code repositories
- Collaboration
- Issues, pull requests, CI/CD

## 6. Testing Types
- **Unit Test**: Test individual functions
- **Integration Test**: Test modules together
- **System Test**: Test full system
- **UAT**: User Acceptance Testing
- **Regression Test**: Ensure old features work

---

## 7. Debugging & Troubleshooting
- Find & fix errors
- Use logs & debuggers
- Reproduce the bug
- Understand root cause

---

## 8. Documentation
- Readme
- API docs
- Code comments
- User manual

Good documentation makes maintenance easier.

---

## 9. Clean Code Principles
- Meaningful names
- Small functions
- Consistent style
- No duplicate code (DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Readable > clever

---

## 10. Design Principles
- **SOLID**
- **DRY**
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **YAGNI** (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)

---

## 11. Project Management Tools
- Jira
- Trello
- Asana
- GitHub Projects
