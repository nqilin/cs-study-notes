# Week 1 Report - CS-Study-Notes
**Period**: Day 1 ~ Day 7
**Theme**: GitHub profile setup & Python basic grammar foundation

## 📌 What I've Done This Week
1. Finished GitHub profile optimization:
   - Professional English bio & personal information
   - Profile README with clear positioning and skills

2. Built 3 core repositories:
   - cs-study-notes (study notes)
   - python-small-tools (practical small tools)
   - leetcode-training (algorithm practice)

3. Completed 4 Python basic grammar notes:
   - Print & Basic Data Types
   - Variables & Operators
   - Control Flow - Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
   - Control Flow - Loops (for & while)

4. Standardized repository rules:
   - English document content
   - Standard commit message format: `type: content`
   - Unified file naming and directory structure
   - MIT license added

## 🎯 Knowledge Mastery
- Python basic output & built-in types
- Variable definition, naming rules and operators
- Logical branch control with conditional statements
- Loop structure and traversal with for & while

## 🛠️ Problems & Improvements
- Minor markdown formatting issues: fixed by standardizing code blocks, headers and dividers
- Commit messages are now consistent and professional

## 📅 Plan for Next Week
- Start Python function & data structure notes
- Begin first practical small tool in python-small-tools
- Continue to keep daily update and standard submission

## 💡 Summary
Week 1 focused on environment setup, basic norms and Python grammar entry.
I have established a stable update habit and a clear repository structure, laying a solid foundation for later study and project development.
